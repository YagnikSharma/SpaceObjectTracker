YOLOv8 Object Detector for Space Station Equipment

This script analyzes images to detect specific objects in space station environments:
- Toolboxes and maintenance equipment
- Oxygen tanks and life support systems
- Fire extinguishers and safety equipment

It uses a YOLOv8 model trained specifically for these objects.
