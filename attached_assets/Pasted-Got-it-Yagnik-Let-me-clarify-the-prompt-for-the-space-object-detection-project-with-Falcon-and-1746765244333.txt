Got it, Yagnik! Let me clarify the prompt for the **space object detection** project with Falcon and the **AI chatbot** as your assistant. Here's the refined, accurate prompt:

---

### **Project Setup for Space Object Detection using Falcon (Duality Company) + AI Chatbot**

**Objective:**
Develop a web application that integrates **space object detection** using **Falcon API** and incorporates an **AI chatbot** (powered by GPT) as a personal assistant to interact with users. This application will focus solely on space object detection from Falcon, with chatbot functionality to assist in explaining results.

---

**Steps:**

1. **Frontend (React):**

   * Set up a **React-based frontend**:

     * A **file upload interface** for uploading space images (e.g., satellite images, space debris).
     * A **results display section** showing detected space objects (bounding boxes, labels, etc.).
     * A **chatbot interface** to allow users to query detected objects and receive responses from the AI chatbot.

2. **Backend (Falcon):**

   * Set up **Falcon API** to:

     * **Receive uploaded images** from the frontend.
     * **Process these images** using the space object detection model (possibly integrated with YOLOv11 or any other detection mechanism).
     * Send **detected object data** (coordinates, labels) to the frontend for display.
     * Integrate **GPT-powered AI chatbot** for users to ask questions regarding the detected objects.

3. **Space Object Detection (Falcon + YOLOv11):**

   * Process uploaded images for **space object detection**:

     * **Use Falcon API** to handle image processing and object detection.
     * Use **YOLOv11** or another detection algorithm to identify objects in the uploaded images.
     * Return **detection results** to the frontend (bounding boxes, object labels, etc.).

4. **AI Chatbot (GPT Integration):**

   * Integrate **GPT** (using your API key) to create an **interactive chatbot** that:

     * Responds to **queries** like “What space objects were detected?” or “Provide a summary of the detected objects.”
     * Uses **data from the Falcon object detection** (e.g., detected objects, coordinates) to answer intelligently.
     * Could allow users to inquire about different space objects, detect new ones, or get further analysis.

5. **Database (Optional for Tracking):**

   * Set up **Replit DB or SQLite** if you need to store data, such as:

     * History of space objects detected.
     * User interactions with the AI chatbot (logs for future improvement).
     * Object detection statistics.

6. **Deployment:**

   * Deploy the entire application on **Replit**:

     * Ensure the **React frontend** communicates seamlessly with **Falcon’s API** for object detection.
     * Host and deploy the backend using **Replit’s cloud hosting**.
     * Provide real-time interaction between the **image upload, object detection**, and **chatbot response** systems.

**Technologies:**

* **Frontend**: React (with basic UI components for image upload, results display, and chatbot interaction).
* **Backend**: Falcon API (handles image processing and object detection).
* **AI Model**: YOLOv11 or another suitable model for space object detection.
* **Chatbot**: GPT (using your personal API key for user interactions).
* **Database**: Optional (Replit DB or SQLite for storing detected objects or chatbot logs).
* **Deployment**: Replit for both frontend and backend hosting.

**Instructions for Replit:**

1. Set up **Falcon API** for backend processing (space object detection and chatbot interaction).
2. Integrate **YOLOv11** (or another detection model) for object detection in uploaded space images.
3. Create the **React frontend** to allow users to interact with the system (upload images, chat with the AI).
4. Ensure **Falcon API** communicates with the frontend for smooth real-time responses.
5. Deploy the application seamlessly on **Replit** for the hackathon demo.
