### 🛠️ Replit AI Command — Final Project Fixes & Optimization (Clean, Structured, Minimal-Credit Use)

---

#### ⚠️ Phase 1: Remove Unwanted/Unused Features

1. **Remove Light/Dark Mode Toggle Completely**

   * Delete all code, scripts, and styles related to theme toggling.
   * Reason: Partial implementation, unnecessary credit usage, and no full-site effect.

2. **Clean Up Project Folder**

   * Remove unused files (e.g. placeholder images, test scripts, redundant styles).
   * Only retain files directly used by pages or components.

#### 🧭 Phase 2: Navigation Fixes

3. **Fix Broken Navigation to Detection Hub**

   * Ensure clicking on **“Detection Hub”** from *any tab* (Galactic Map, Stellar Archives, Mission Control) routes properly — not to the homepage.

4. **Split “Detection Tool” / “Detection Hub” Toggles**

   * Add two **distinct navigation buttons**:

     * **Detection Hub** → leads to actual detection hub page.
     * **Mission Control** → leads to mission control page.
   * Ensure these are styled similarly but lead to different, correct destinations.

5. **Fix "Start New Detection" Button**

   * On **Mission Control**, clicking **Start New Detection** should go to **Detection Hub**, not homepage.

#### 🎨 Phase 3: Styling Consistency

6. **Apply Theme Site-Wide**

   * Use consistent **dark black (#000000)** and **navy blue (#0a2a43)** throughout all pages:

     * Nav bar, text, headings, buttons, section backgrounds.

7. **Fix Nav Bar Proportions**

   * Standardize **nav bar height, padding, and alignment** across all pages.
   * Avoid layout shifting due to inconsistent margins or CSS overrides.

8. **Fix Missing Images in Galactic Map & Stellar Archives**

   * Locate and fix image paths or `<img>` tag issues.
   * If image sources are invalid or missing, remove those tiles to maintain clean UI.

#### 📱 Phase 4: Performance + Responsiveness Polish

9. **Ensure Mobile + Desktop Responsiveness**

   * Use media queries to fix any layout breakage on tablets/mobiles.
   * Ensure nav bar, buttons, text, and image blocks scale correctly and don’t overflow.

10. **Optimize Image Sizes**

    * Compress large images without quality loss.
    * Use `loading="lazy"` on non-critical images to improve load time.

11. **Minimize JS & CSS Bloat**

    * Remove unused classes, redundant styles, and scripts not being referenced.
    * Keep the final build lightweight.
