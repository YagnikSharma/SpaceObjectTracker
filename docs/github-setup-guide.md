# GitHub Repository Setup Guide for Syndetect

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up a GitHub repository for the Syndetect project, ensuring proper organization and structure for collaboration and version control.

## Creating a New GitHub Repository

### Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Account

1. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one at [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Log in to your GitHub account

### Step 2: Create a New Repository

1. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner of GitHub's interface
2. Select "New repository"
3. Fill in the repository details:
   * **Repository name**: `syndetect` (or your preferred name)
   * **Description**: "Advanced AI-powered space object detection platform"
   * **Visibility**: Choose between Public or Private based on your requirements
   * **Initialize with**:
     * ✓ Add a README file
     * ✓ Add .gitignore (select Node from the template dropdown)
     * ✓ Choose a license (MIT recommended for open-source projects)
4. Click "Create repository"

## Setting Up Your Local Repository

### Step 1: Clone the New Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/syndetect.git
   cd syndetect
   ```

### Step 2: Prepare the Project Structure

Create the following directory structure for your project:

```bash
mkdir -p client/src/{components,pages,lib,assets}
mkdir -p server/{routes,services,storage}
mkdir -p shared
mkdir -p public
mkdir -p uploads
mkdir -p results
```

## Adding a Comprehensive .gitignore File

Replace the default .gitignore with a more comprehensive one:

1. Open the `.gitignore` file in your editor
2. Replace its contents with the following:

```
# Dependencies
node_modules/
.pnp/
.pnp.js

# Testing
coverage/

# Production
build/
dist/

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
logs
*.log

# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
venv/
env/
.env/
.venv/

.Python

build/
develop-eggs/
dist/

.eggs/
lib/
lib64/

sdist/

*.egg-info/
.installed.cfg
*.egg
*.manifest
*.spec
.pytest_cache/

# ML Models (optional - these can be large)
# *.pt
# *.pth
# *.onnx

# Uploaded files
uploads/*
!uploads/.gitkeep

# Results
results/*
!results/.gitkeep

# OS specific files
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
ehthumbs.db
Thumbs.db

# Editor directories and files
.idea/
.vscode/*
!.vscode/extensions.json
!.vscode/settings.json
!.vscode/tasks.json
!.vscode/launch.json
*.suo
*.ntvs*
*.njsproj
*.sln
*.sw?
```

3. Create empty `.gitkeep` files to track empty directories:
   ```bash
   touch uploads/.gitkeep
   touch results/.gitkeep
   ```

## Transferring Your Project Files

### Option 1: Copy Files from Existing Project

If you have an existing Syndetect project:

1. Copy all project files to your cloned repository, preserving the directory structure
2. Ensure you don't copy `.git` directories from the original project

### Option 2: Starting Fresh

If you're starting the project from scratch:

1. Set up the basic project structure as outlined above
2. Add your code files to the appropriate directories
3. Follow the `docs/local-setup-guide.md` for setting up the development environment

## Committing and Pushing Your Code

Once your files are in place:

1. Add the files to Git tracking:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Syndetect project setup"
   ```

3. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Setting Up Branch Protection (Optional)

For collaborative projects, consider setting up branch protection:

1. On GitHub, go to your repository
2. Click "Settings" > "Branches"
3. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule"
4. Enter "main" as the branch name pattern
5. Configure protection settings:
   * ✓ Require pull request reviews before merging
   * ✓ Require status checks to pass before merging
   * ✓ Include administrators
6. Click "Create"

## Managing Large Files

If your project includes large files like ML models (YOLOv8 .pt files):

### Option 1: Include Models in the Repository

If the models are essential and relatively small (< 50MB):
- Uncomment the model files section in .gitignore to include them
- Add and commit them as normal

### Option 2: Use Git LFS (Large File Storage)

For larger model files:
1. Install Git LFS from [git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
2. Initialize Git LFS:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```
3. Track the large files:
   ```bash
   git lfs track "*.pt"
   git lfs track "*.pth"
   ```
4. Add the .gitattributes file:
   ```bash
   git add .gitattributes
   ```
5. Add, commit, and push as normal

### Option 3: Set Up a Model Download Script

For the most flexible approach:
1. Keep model files excluded from Git
2. Create a `download_models.py` script that fetches the models from a hosting service
3. Update your documentation to instruct users to run this script

## Documentation

Ensure your repository includes these essential documentation files:

1. **README.md**: Main project overview (already created)
2. **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributing to the project
3. **LICENSE**: Your chosen license file
4. **docs/**: Directory for detailed documentation (already set up)

## Next Steps

After successfully setting up your GitHub repository:

1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
2. Configure issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
3. Create a project board to track development tasks
4. Add project collaborators if working in a team

By following this guide, you'll have a well-structured GitHub repository for your Syndetect project that follows best practices for version control and collaboration.
